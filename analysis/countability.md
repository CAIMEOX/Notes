# Countability

## Finite / Infinite Set
- A set $X$ is **finite** if $X$ is empty or there are $n\in \mathbb{N}^\times$ and a bijection from $\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$ to $X$
- If a set is not finite then it's **infinite**

## Countable
(Abuse of notation: Use $\sim$ to represent **equinumerous set**, i.e. there is a bijection between them)
- A set $X$ is called **countably infinite** if $X\sim\mathbb{N}$ and we say $X$ is countable if $X\sim\mathbb{N}$ or $X$ is finite
- $X$ is uncountable if $X$ is not countable

## Propositions
- Any subset of a countable set is countable
- A countable union of countable sets is countable
- A finite product of countable sets is countable
