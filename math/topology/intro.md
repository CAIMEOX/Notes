# Topology
Topology is a fascinating study of spaces and their properties. It provides a foundation for many areas of mathematics, including analysis, algebraic geometry, and differential geometry.

## Preliminaries
Before starting, you'd better have learned set theory and real analysis.
- Set Theory: Ensure you have a good understanding of set theory. (Point Set) Topology is deeply rooted in set theory, and concepts like open and closed sets are central to the subject.
- Real Analysis: A solid foundation in real analysis, especially concepts like continuity and convergence, will be beneficial.

## Topological Space
At first you need to learn the basic knowledge about topological spaces. Focus on the basic concepts of topological spaces, open and closed sets, topological bases, and continuity.

## Euclidean Topology
The euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is one of the central characters of topology.
