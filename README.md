Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I've gathered a collection of my notes and resources on **mathematics**, **physics**, **computer science**, **type theory** and more. This repository serves as a hub for my personal learning journey and a platform where I can share my knowledge with others who are passionate about these subjects. 

## What You'll Find:
 This repository is organized into folders and subfolders, making it easy to navigate and find the information you're looking for. Here's a breakdown of what you can expect to discover:

### Computer Science
- [Agda](./cs/agda/intro.md)
- [Ocaml](Ocaml.md)
- [Lambda Calculus](./cs/tt/lambda.md)
- [Operating System (Rust)](cs/os/intro.md)
- [Simple Type Theory](./cs/tt/type_theory.md)

### Mathematics
- [Algebra](./math/algebra/intro.md)
- [Category Theory](./math/cat/intro.md)
- [Real analysis](math/analysis/intro.md)
- [Topology](./math/topology/intro.md)

## Get Started
- All the notes were written in Obsidian Markdown so you may need to install **obsidian** first.
- Explore the folders and subfolders to find notes on specific topics.
- All the topics have a `intro.md` which gives a brief introduction to the specific topic.
- Check out the [Recommended Reading Lists](#recommended-reading-lists) section for resources to enhance your knowledge.
- Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or ask questions.
